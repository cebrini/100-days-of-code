# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: July 24, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finally completed FreeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript Challenges

**Thoughts:** I would have completed the challenges sooner, but got hung up on the profile lookup challenge which took me way longer than I expected to complete. It's OK though, I have to expect a few bumps in the road. Funny that I completed most of the other Basic Javascript Challenges back in May/June. Oh well! Onward and upward!

### Day 1: July 26, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Actually, Yesterday's progress. Long story.

**Thoughts:** Well at least two fails today. First I tweeted the wrong number for the day. I had forgotten that I started my count from zero and instead made it Day 2. The second fail was no being able to  finish the freecodecamp Basic algolrithms Mutation challenge. Decided to put it aside for a bit.


### Day 2: July 27, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Really! Decided to give Mutation a rest and move on to the next challenge aka Falsy Bouncer.

**Thoughts:** Falsy Bouncer was surprisingly easy to solve, at least complared to Mutation of which I haven't solved yet. I'll revisit Mutation later. For now I think I'll try to complete the other challenges in the basic Algorithm section.

### Day 3: July 29, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Still struggling, but completed the "Search and Destroy" challenge.

**Thoughts:** I didn't report anything for July 28th not because I wasn't working on code, but because I didn't feel like I had anything to show for my effort. While it's true I didn't complete a challenge, I feel in retrospect that I did benefit from putting the effort in. I hope to improve and be more consistant as I complete the 100 days. I hope to do another 100 days of code after I finish the first 100 days.

### Day 4: July 30, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Rot13 challenge.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit better about making head way. Got a good start on finishing up ROT13. Still not happy with my pace and it looks like I'll be filing these comments as retrospectives since my current pattern is tweeting and git commiting after midnight. I'm not sure if that's a problem though. Right now I'm not going to worry about it. I'll just continue focusing on getting something done each day.
