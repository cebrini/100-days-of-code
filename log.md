# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: July 24, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finally completed FreeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript Challenges

**Thoughts:** I would have completed the challenges sooner, but got hung up on the profile lookup challenge which took me way longer than I expected to complete. It's OK though, I have to expect a few bumps in the road. Funny that I completed most of the other Basic Javascript Challenges back in May/June. Oh well! Onward and upward!

### Day 1: July 26, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Actually, Yesterday's progress. Long story.

**Thoughts:** Well at least two fails today. First I tweeted the wrong number for the day. I had forgotten that I started my count from zero and instead made it Day 2. The second fail was no being able to  finish the freecodecamp Basic algolrithms Mutation challenge. Decided to put it aside for a bit.


### Day 2: July 27, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Really! Decided to give Mutation a rest and move on to the next challenge aka Falsy Bouncer.

**Thoughts:** Falsy Bouncer was surprisingly easy to solve, at least complared to Mutation of which I haven't solved yet. I'll revisit Mutation later. For now I think I'll try to complete the other challenges in the basic Algorithm section.

### Day 3: July 29, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Still struggling, but completed the "Search and Destroy" challenge.

**Thoughts:** I didn't report anything for July 28th not because I wasn't working on code, but because I didn't feel like I had anything to show for my effort. While it's true I didn't complete a challenge, I feel in retrospect that I did benefit from putting the effort in. I hope to improve and be more consistant as I complete the 100 days. I hope to do another 100 days of code after I finish the first 100 days.

### Day 4: July 30, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Rot13 challenge.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit better about making head way. Got a good start on finishing up ROT13. Still not happy with my pace and it looks like I'll be filing these comments as retrospectives since my current pattern is tweeting and git commiting after midnight. I'm not sure if that's a problem though. Right now I'm not going to worry about it. I'll just continue focusing on getting something done each day.


### Day 5: July 31, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Completed ROT13 Challenge! Yay!

**Thoughts:** Got a late start. Began around 11pm and just finished at 3am :-/ Even though I took me a while, it didn't seem as difficult this time. More of a psychological thing than a time constraint thing. This is good news. The time to completion should get shorter the more I do this (this being coding).

#### Day6: August 1, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on "Where do I belong" for a couple of hours.

**Thoughts:** I have some ideas on how to complete this, but I'm just too tired right now. Will pickup where I left off tomorrow.


### Day 7: Aug 2, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Completed Mutation (Finally)!

**Thoughts:** I completed the Mutation challenge from @freecodecamp's Basic Algorithms after struggling with it off and on for weeks. the breakthroough came when I finally gsve up on **NOT** using a for loop. That's right! I didn't think I needed to use a for loop, and for all but one of the inputs I didn't. mutation("floor", "for") was my little bete noir. But, not anymore!


### Day 8: Aug 3, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Completed "Where do I belong" Challenge!

**Thoughts:** I'm done with all the Basic Algorithm challenges. Plan on going back to do the tribute and the porfolio challenges. I expect they will take more time so I'll  also see if I can bang oout a couple of the intermediate algorithm challenges (if possible).


### Day 9: Aug 4, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Complete "Sum All Numbers in a Range" From the @freecodecamp Intermediate Algorithm challenges

**Thoughts:** Really didn't feel like doing today's coding, but once I got started it came pretty easily.
Hope the easy part continues for a while!

### Day 10: Aug 5, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on "Diff Two Arrays" from @freecodecamp Intermediate Algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much done as I would like today. Hoping I'll be more productive tomorrow.

### Day 11: Aug 6, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Almost have "Diff Two Arrays" from @freecodecamp Intermediate Algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts:** Accomplished quite a bit. I expect to complete the challenge by my next entery and begin work on the next one. Feeling more motivated the more I do. I hope this is a trend! 


### Day 12: Aug 7, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Completed "Diff two Arrays" from @freecodecamp Intermediate Algorithm callenges.

**Thoughts:** Glad to complete another one of the challenges. I didn't use all the suggested array methods that the list. I guess that's alright but should probably go back and see if I missed learning something. I still want to improve on the length of time it takes me to do these challenges. I've noticed some improvement. I'm sure if I stick to it I'll improve over time.


### Day 13: Aug 8, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Started work on "Roman Numeral Converter"

**Thoughts:** DIdn't get as much accomplished as I wanted to today. Will start fresh tomorrow.
