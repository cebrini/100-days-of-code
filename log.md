# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: July 24, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finally completed FreeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript Challenges

**Thoughts:** I would have completed the challenges sooner, but got hung up on the profile lookup challenge which took me way longer than I expected to complete. It's OK though, I have to expect a few bumps in the road. Funny that I completed most of the other Basic Javascript Challenges back in May/June. Oh well! Onward and upward!
