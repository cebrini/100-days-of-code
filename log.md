# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: July 24, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finally completed FreeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript Challenges

**Thoughts:** I would have completed the challenges sooner, but got hung up on the profile lookup challenge which took me way longer than I expected to complete. It's OK though, I have to expect a few bumps in the road. Funny that I completed most of the other Basic Javascript Challenges back in May/June. Oh well! Onward and upward!

### Day 1: July 26, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Actually, Yesterday's progress. Long story.

**Thoughts:** Well at least two fails today. First I tweeted the wrong number for the day. I had forgotten that I started my count from zero and instead made it Day 2. The second fail was no being able to  finish the freecodecamp Basic algolrithms Mutation challenge. Decided to put it aside for a bit.


### Day 2: July 27, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Really! Decided to give Mutation a rest and move on to the next challenge aka Falsy Bouncer.

**Thoughts:** Falsy Bouncer was surprisingly easy to solve, at least complared to Mutation of which I haven't solved yet. I'll revisit Mutation later. For now I think I'll try to complete the other challenges in the basic Algorithm section.

### Day 3: July 29, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Still struggling, but completed the "Search and Destroy" challenge.

**Thoughts:** I didn't report anything for July 28th not because I wasn't working on code, but because I didn't feel like I had anything to show for my effort. While it's true I didn't complete a challenge, I feel in retrospect that I did benefit from putting the effort in. I hope to improve and be more consistant as I complete the 100 days. I hope to do another 100 days of code after I finish the first 100 days.

### Day 4: July 30, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Rot13 challenge.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit better about making head way. Got a good start on finishing up ROT13. Still not happy with my pace and it looks like I'll be filing these comments as retrospectives since my current pattern is tweeting and git commiting after midnight. I'm not sure if that's a problem though. Right now I'm not going to worry about it. I'll just continue focusing on getting something done each day.


### Day 5: July 31, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Completed ROT13 Challenge! Yay!

**Thoughts:** Got a late start. Began around 11pm and just finished at 3am :-/ Even though I took me a while, it didn't seem as difficult this time. More of a psychological thing than a time constraint thing. This is good news. The time to completion should get shorter the more I do this (this being coding).

#### Day6: August 1, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on "Where do I belong" for a couple of hours.

**Thoughts:** I have some ideas on how to complete this, but I'm just too tired right now. Will pickup where I left off tomorrow.


### Day 7: Aug 2, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Completed Mutation (Finally)!

**Thoughts:** I completed the Mutation challenge from @freecodecamp's Basic Algorithms after struggling with it off and on for weeks. the breakthroough came when I finally gsve up on **NOT** using a for loop. That's right! I didn't think I needed to use a for loop, and for all but one of the inputs I didn't. mutation("floor", "for") was my little bete noir. But, not anymore!


### Day 8: Aug 3, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Completed "Where do I belong" Challenge!

**Thoughts:** I'm done with all the Basic Algorithm challenges. Plan on going back to do the tribute and the porfolio challenges. I expect they will take more time so I'll  also see if I can bang oout a couple of the intermediate algorithm challenges (if possible).


### Day 9: Aug 4, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Complete "Sum All Numbers in a Range" From the @freecodecamp Intermediate Algorithm challenges

**Thoughts:** Really didn't feel like doing today's coding, but once I got started it came pretty easily.
Hope the easy part continues for a while!

### Day 10: Aug 5, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on "Diff Two Arrays" from @freecodecamp Intermediate Algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much done as I would like today. Hoping I'll be more productive tomorrow.

### Day 11: Aug 6, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Almost have "Diff Two Arrays" from @freecodecamp Intermediate Algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts:** Accomplished quite a bit. I expect to complete the challenge by my next entery and begin work on the next one. Feeling more motivated the more I do. I hope this is a trend! 


### Day 12: Aug 7, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Completed "Diff two Arrays" from @freecodecamp Intermediate Algorithm callenges.

**Thoughts:** Glad to complete another one of the challenges. I didn't use all the suggested array methods that the list. I guess that's alright but should probably go back and see if I missed learning something. I still want to improve on the length of time it takes me to do these challenges. I've noticed some improvement. I'm sure if I stick to it I'll improve over time.


### Day 13: Aug 8, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Started work on "Roman Numeral Converter"

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much accomplished as I wanted to today. Will start fresh tomorrow.

### Day 14: Aug 9, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Studied MDN's Docs on Array.prototype.<stuff>

**Thoughts:** Decided to work on reviewing the documentation on MDN since most of the challenges for the @freeecodecamp Intermediate Algorithms stuff use a subset of the Array.prototype methods(?). My hope is that the review will help me speed up completing the challenges.

### Day 15: Aug 10, 2006

**Today's Progress:** Worked on "Roman Numeral Converter"

**Thoughts:** Spent bulk of time on RNC challenge, but nibbled on a couple of the other Intermediate Algorithm challenges as well. I didn't complete them, but did make progress all the same.

### Day 16: Aug 11, 2016

**Today's Progress:** attempted to solve some of the other Intermediate Algorithm problems.

**Thoughts:** Didn't seem to be making much head way with the Roman Numeral Converter, so I made an attempt at solving some of the other algorithm challenges. 

### Day 17-19:  Aug 14, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finally completed another challenge!

**Thoughts:** Yes I was a bad boy and didn't add to this log for several days. But, in my defense I was working on coding. I just didn't feel like I was making progress at the time. However, I broke through one of my blocks and completed another Intermediate Algorithm challenge from @freecodecamp. The challenge? Binary Agents.


### Day 20: Aug 16, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Roman Numeral Converter Again. Getrting close!

**Thoughts:** Turned my attention back to the Roman Numeral Converter problem and actually made some real progress. I hope to be finished with it by the end of Wednesday. 


### Day 21: Aug 17, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finally completed the Roman Numeral Converter challenge.

**Thoughts:** Was happy to get this one done. I was starting to question if this was a good idea.

### Day 22: Aug 18, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Started working on another @FreeCodeCamp Intermediate Algorithms Challenge Called "Everthing Be True".

**Thoughts:** I don't think it will take me long to complete it. Wonder when I'll start completing more at once. Oh well! Time will tell!


### Day 23: Aug 19, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Almost finished with Everthing Be True.

**Thoughts:** I'd be finished with this challenge but for one test that fails NaN isn't being detected for some strange reason and I'm running out of ideas how to fix it. May have to cry uncle and ask for help.
"Everything Be True" isn't the only challenge that is waiting on just one test to pass. I have at least one other challenge that is causing me fits. Oh well I'll get it eventually.


### Day 24: Aug 20, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Completed "Everything Be True" Challenge!

**Thoughts:** Solved the problem I was having with  detecting the NaN emelent in the array. Solve by going to MDN and reading up on NaN. RTFM! On to the next challenge!


### Day 25: Aug 21, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Spent time reviewing documentation on Arrays.

**Thoughts:** Decided to take it easy and just review what I've learned. I will continue tomorrow with another intermediate algorithm challenge.


### Day 26: Aug 22, 2016

**Today's Progress:** worked on several Intermediate Algorithm challenges

**Thoughts:**  Should have at least one of the challenges done sometime tomorrow. I'm working on "Wherefore Art Thou" and Steamroller and one of two others.


### Day 27: Aug 23, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Completed "Wherefore Art Thou" Intermediate Algorithm Challenge.

**Thoughts:** Fell asleep at the keyboard, but after the nap was able to complete this challenge.
