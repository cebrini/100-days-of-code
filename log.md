# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: July 24, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finally completed FreeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript Challenges

**Thoughts:** I would have completed the challenges sooner, but got hung up on the profile lookup challenge which took me way longer than I expected to complete. It's OK though, I have to expect a few bumps in the road. Funny that I completed most of the other Basic Javascript Challenges back in May/June. Oh well! Onward and upward!

### Day 1: July 26, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Actually, Yesterday's progress. Long story.

**Thoughts:** Well at least two fails today. First I tweeted the wrong number for the day. I had forgotten that I started my count from zero and instead made it Day 2. The second fail was no being able to  finish the freecodecamp Basic algolrithms Mutation challenge. Decided to put it aside for a bit.


### Day 2: July 27, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Really! Decided to give Mutation a rest and move on to the next challenge aka Falsy Bouncer.

**Thoughts:** Falsy Bouncer was surprisingly easy to solve, at least complared to Mutation of which I haven't solved yet. I'll revisit Mutation later. For now I think I'll try to complete the other challenges in the basic Algorithm section.
